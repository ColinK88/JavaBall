# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.  However, in our case we can keep it as a little story about our project.

### Our little story ###

We're attempting to create software to assist someone working in a JavaBall league's office with the task of creating a schedule for the league's referees.

###Classes###

Our choice of classes has some logic to it.  

- Referees will have to be included in some listing of refrees.  
- Matches take place over a season.
- The rest speaks for itself.

### What is this repository for? ###

* We'll use this repository to collaborate on our project.
* We're currently at version 0.0.1... probably.
* If you want to learn markdown here's a link to bitbucket's tutorial. [Learn Markdown](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo)

### Who do I talk to? ###

* If any of us are stuck with git ask Craig, and he'll ask Ciaran.  If you're Craig ask Ciaran.  Bitbucket's "201" tutorial is really good, covering (most notably) pulling and forking.
